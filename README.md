# PfATP4 protein structure predicted with AlphaFold2

This project is one of our contributions to Open Source Malaria (OSM). Previous OSM docking results with homology modeling did not yield satisfactory outcomes, so we produce a new structure with (hopefully) better accuracy.

## What we did

1. PfATP4 multiple sequence alignment with HHBlits.
2. Run AlphaFold2 pipeline with a Google Colaboratory notebook (full credit to @SoedingL)
